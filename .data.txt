# This is for heteronyms - words that are spelled one way but can be pronouced differently depending on meaning.
# it looks for the word lead then offers the choice of reed or red and depending on your selection it will change the spelling in the text.
# As the program changes things to lower case I've offered some choices like OBject and UBject to make it easier to distinquish visual the procouciation.
# since the program converts all to lowercase this doesn't matter and I did a small test to confirm that eb2ab has no issue procouncing
# CONtest and contest exactly the same. If convert to lowercase is dissabled then it shouldn't be an issue.
